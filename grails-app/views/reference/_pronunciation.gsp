<h2 id="pronunciation">Pronunciation</h2>
<p>In some ways it's easier to ascertain to pronunciation of a Kinyarwanda word from it's written form than an English
word. Because Kinyarwanda has only been a written language for about a hundred years, the pronunciation of different
letters is almost completely consistent throughout the language. Even words that are borrowed from other languages are
given a proper Kinyarwanda spelling (e.g. <ki:queryLink>sock</ki:queryLink> &rarr; <span lang="rw"><ki:queryLink>isogisi</ki:queryLink></span>).</p>

<p>However, Kinyarwanda is a tonal language and the tones can completely change the meaning of a word
(e.g. <span lang="rw"><ki:queryLink>gusura</ki:queryLink></span>). To be properly understood you will need to learn to
distinguish different tones.</p>
