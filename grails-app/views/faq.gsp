					<p><a name="cantfindword"></a><b>Why doesn't this dictionary contain ...?</b><br/>
						There are many reasons why you might not be able to find the word you are looking for. Firstly,
						the dictionary might be missing the word. We try to spot missing words by looking at the logs of
						what people have searched for, and then add them if appropriate. Secondly you might be searching
						for a conjugated form of a verb rather than the general form. Try stripping off prefixes and
						suffixes, e.g. <i>ndagukunda</i> which means 'I love you' becomes just <i>kunda</i> which is the
						verb 'to love'.</p>
				</li>

					<p><a name="howaccurate"></a><b>How accurate is this dictionary?</b><br/>
						All dictionaries have mistakes and this dictionary is no exception. This dictionary is also very
						much still a work in progress. Some entries have been copied from older dictionaries and have
						not yet been verified. If you find something that you think is incorrect, please
						<a href="/feedback">tell us</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><a name="download"></a><b>Can I download the dictionary?</b><br/>
						This dictionary is open source so <a class="link" href="/feedback">contact us</a> and we can
						send you the data. Please remember that it is always being updated so such data will become out
					of date quickly, and there is no printable version of the dictionary.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><a name="searchpartial"></a><b>How do I search for part of a word?</b><br/>
						You can use the * character as a wildcard, for example:
						<ul>
							<li><ki:queryLink>ama*</ki:queryLink> will match all words beginning with 'ama'</li>
							<li><ki:queryLink>*gura</ki:queryLink> will match all words ending with 'gura'</li>
							<li><ki:queryLink>*kinya*</ki:queryLink> will match all words containing 'kinya'</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><a name="rudewords"></a><b>Why does this dictionary contain rude words?</b><br/>
						Most words that people might consider rude in one context have a legitimate meaning in another
						context. Therefore this dictionary strives to contain all valid words regardless of any rude
						connotations, but does denote these words as having such connotations.</p>
				</li>

					<p><a name="getinvolved"></a><b>How can I get involved?</b><br/>
